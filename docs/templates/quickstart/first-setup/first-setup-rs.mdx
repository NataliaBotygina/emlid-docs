        !!! tip "Windows OS"
                Windows may ask you to enter the PIN from the router label to connect to the network. Choose *Connect 
                using a security key instead* option.

{%endif%}

!!! note ""
    If your device did not connect to a Wi-Fi network, it will switch back to hotspot mode.
    In that case, repeat the steps and double check your network name and password. 


### Accessing Reach {{model}} device in a network

!!! danger ""
    Make sure that your smartphone/PC has connected to the same Wi-Fi network as Reach.

??? note "Using Reach with iOS/Android device"

    1. Open the ReachView 3 app
    2. Refresh the list of devices
    3. Tap *reach*

!!! danger "Reach can't work on the 192.168.2.xx subnet"

    As 192.168.2.x subnet is reserved inside Reach for Ethernet connections, you will need to perform initial setup in a different Wi-Fi or change router settings. Routers usually have a setting to change the subnet address, so you can set it to 192.168.1.xx

### Updating ReachView 3

After connecting to Reach {{model}}, you will see ReachView Updater again. Wait until it checks for the latest updates.

* If there is an update, press the *Update ReachView* button and wait. This process will take a few minutes

* When it is done tap the *Reboot and go to the app* button to reboot Reach {{model}}

* Wait for the blue LED to stop blinking, showing that Reach RS2 has joined your Wi-Fi network again

* If you use ReachView 3 app, swipe right to get back to the list of devices, refresh the list and tap *reach*. As for the web browser, just refresh the page with ReachView 3. You will see the filling Emlid logo indicating the loading process of ReachView 3

Your Reach {{model}} is ready for work. Do the same with all other units.
